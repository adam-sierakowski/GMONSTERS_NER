# 🧌 gmonsters_ner – Custom Polish Monster NER

This project is an exercise in training custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) model in Spacy.

It contains a model trained to detect monster names from the games Gothic, Gothic 2 and Gothic 2: Night of the Raven (e.g. *goblin*, *ścierwojadów*, *orkiem-szamanem*) in Polish forum-style texts.

Built using spaCy and trained on automatically annotated sentences from themodders.org forum.

👀 Note: model recognizes *inflected* Polish wordforms without lemmatization.

Base Spacy model: pl_core_news_md

# 🔍 Example

input:
```
Ścierwojady – tak nazywamy te wielkie ptaszyska – należy atakować jeden po drugim.
```
output:
```
[('Ścierwojady', 'MONSTER')]
```

# 🛠 How to use

```bash
pip install spacy
```

```python
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("gmonsters_ner_0.1")

doc = nlp("A i na wszelki wypadek, gdyby nie chciał się pojawić ścierwojad i ten ork podaję na nich kody:")
print([(ent.text, ent.label_) for ent in doc.ents])
```

# 📊 Metrics

On the held-out test set:
- Precision: ~91%
- Recall: ~92%
- F1-score: ~91%

The model is able to recognize novel monsters that were not annotated in the training and test datasets (see the note in next section). This drives the precision down, but is a good thing. It could also mean that there are false positives, which is a bad thing. More testing would be needed to find this out.

# 🖋️ How the annotations were created

1. Monster lemmas were taken from the games fan wikis ([1](https://gothic.fandom.com/pl/wiki/Bestiariusz_w_Gothic), [2](https://gothic.fandom.com/pl/wiki/Bestiariusz_w_Gothic_II), [2NOTR](https://gothic.fandom.com/pl/wiki/Bestiariusz_w_Gothic_II:_Noc_Kruka))
2. Lemmas were expanded to wordforms using a mixed approach:
    - [polimorf dictionary](https://zil.ipipan.waw.pl/PoliMorf): the most common monsters, found in the "small" subset
    - ChatGPT: all the other monsters
    - (something like an ML-based reversed lemmatizer would be the best for this task but I couldn't find it)
3. The annotations were created by marking the span of every wordform whenever it appeared in the paragraph.

👀 Note: the annotation is based on a list of monsters that already exist in the games, but the dataset is based on a forum about modifying the game, so it actually contains mentions of novel monsters.
